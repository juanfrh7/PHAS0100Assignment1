Purpose
-------

This project serves as a starting point for the PHAS0100 2021/22 Assignment 1 Game of Life Simulation coursework. It has a reasonable folder structure for [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based projects,
that use [CTest](https://cmake.org/) to run unit tests via [Catch](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2). 

Further information on the specific project is left as an exercise for the student.


Credits
-------

This project is maintained by [Dr. Jim Dobson](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/dr-jim-dobson). It is based on [CMakeCatch2](https://github.com/UCL/CMakeCatch2.git) that was originally developed as a teaching aid for UCL's ["Research Computing with C++"](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/research-computing-with-cpp/)
course developed by [Dr. James Hetherington](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/people/james)
and [Dr. Matt Clarkson](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42).


Build Instructions
------------------

Build and run instructions are left as an excercise for the student. Examples of how to build using cmake were given in lectures and in the other CMake example projects.
